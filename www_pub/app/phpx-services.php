This script has identical behavior as the script that's defined in $codepage, which is typically "myservices.php".

The web server should listen on both ports, e.g. 8881, 8882, and bind the virtual hosts to the SAME directory.

lb.php should be configured to carry parameters that are forwarded by the load balancer.

The load balancer should send all phpx- scripts to a "priority" virtual host; the rest to the "regular" host.

A sample HAProxy config: (/etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg)

        bind *:80
        mode http
        acl fastlane path_beg /GYROSCOPE_FOLDER/phpx-

For HTTPS hosts, the ports and protocols should be adjusted accordingly.
